# Nearby Landmarks App

A Flutter application that fetches the user's current location using GPS, displays the latitude and longitude, and converts the coordinates into a human-readable address using geocoding. The application allows users to save their current location and address as a favorite, persisting it locally using `SharedPreferences`. Proper permission handling is ensured using the `permission_handler` package to access the device's location.
